// 18 Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction

/*

Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;

--- Assignment ---
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

---- Commits ---
Convert assignments to Compound Assignment ( -= )

Uses the -= operator to change a = a - num to
the style of  a -= num; for vars a, b and c
This is called Augmented Subtraction

var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;

// Only modify code below this line

a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
