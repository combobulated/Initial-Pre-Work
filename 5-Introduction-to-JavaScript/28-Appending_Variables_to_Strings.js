// 28 Appending Variables to Strings
/*
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals,
we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

-------- Assignment ------
Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.

------ Commits ----
Append variable to string  with +=

-----------------------*
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "funny";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
