/* Arrays of objects
Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure.
A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow
for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays,
functions, and objects.

Here's an example of a complex data structure:

var ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "Cassette",
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
];

This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various
pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested "formats" array. If
you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the
top level array.

Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example
above, "artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of "artist" and a
value of "Daft Punk".

JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a related data interchange format used
to store data.

{
  "artist": "Daft Punk",
  "title": "Homework",
  "release_year": 1997,
  "formats": [
    "CD",
    "Cassette",
    "LP"
  ],
  "gold": true
}

Note
You will need to place a comma after every object in the array, unless
it is the last object in the array.

----- Assigment---
