/* "Booleans true and false"

Another data type is the Boolean.
Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false.
They are basically little on-off switches, where true
is "on" and false is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note
Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false"
 are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.
