// 25 Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
/*
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value,
it is called the concatenation operator.

Build new strings out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'

Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between
concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

---- Assignment --

  // Example

var myStr = "This is the start. "+"This is the end.";
