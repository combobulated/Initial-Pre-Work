// 27  Constructing Strings with Variables

/*
Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style.
By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more
variables into a string you're building.

----- Assignment ----
Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with
myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"

----- Commits ---
Construct a string with inclusion of a variable

Use concatenation to string var myName inbetween two
string literals; "My Name is" and " And I am well"

----------------*/
// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Jim";
var myStr = "My Name is " + myName + " and I am well!" ;
