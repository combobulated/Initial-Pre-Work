/*
"array variables"
With JavaScript array variables,
we can store several pieces of data in one place.
( this example shows various data types can be stored in same array )

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket,
end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry,
like this:

var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

------ Assignments ----
Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string
 and a number (in that order).

Hint
Refer to the example code in the text editor if you get stuck.

-----Commits---
Make a simple array with an number and String

Creats array myArray = "ap top", 6];
----------*/
// Example
var ourArray = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = ["lap top", 6];
