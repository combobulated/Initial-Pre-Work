<!-- Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document  -->

<!--
* for html structure, doctype must be included as well as the html language element designator

* Browsers need to know which version of HTML your page is using.
* Most recent spec is HTML5, However, older web pages may use previous versions of the language.

* Add the <!DOCTYPE ...> tag on the first line of the html doc
 where the "..." part is the version of HTML. For HTML5, you use <!DOCTYPE html>.


* Uppercase DOCTYPE is important, especially for older browsers. The html is not case sensitive.

* rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags.
* The opening <html> goes directly below the <!DOCTYPE html> line,
* and the closing </html> goes at the end of the page.

* example of the page structure:
-->
<!--
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  Your HTML code goes here
</html>
-->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
