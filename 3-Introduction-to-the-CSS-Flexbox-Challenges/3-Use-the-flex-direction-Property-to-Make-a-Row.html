<!-- 3 Use the flex-direction Property to Make a Row -->

* Flex Containers

* Adding "display: flex" to an element turns it into a flex container.

 - we can now align any children of that element into rows or columns.


* Add the flex-direction property to the parent item
  and setting it to row or column.

  - Creating a row will align the children horizontally,
  - Creating a column will align the children vertically.

* Other options for flex-direction:
  - row-reverse and
  - column-reverse.

* The default value for the flex-direction property is row.

---- Assignment ----

and give it a value of row-reverse.

Demonstrate flex-direction property on box-container.

Adding to #box-container the property flex-direction: row-reverse
results in blue box position to right of red box, as expected.
The default was blue, then red, in horizontal row.
