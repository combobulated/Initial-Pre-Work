 <!-- 13 Use the flex-grow Property to Expand Items -->

The opposite of flex-shrink is the flex-grow property. Recall that flex-shrink
controls the size of the items when the container shrinks.

The "flex-grow property"
 * controls the size of items when the parent container expands.


For exmaple, if one item has a
flex-grow value of 1 and the other has a flex-grow value of 3, t
he one with the value of 3 will grow three times as much as the other.
