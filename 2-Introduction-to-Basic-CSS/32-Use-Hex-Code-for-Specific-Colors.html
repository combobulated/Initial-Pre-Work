<!-- Use Hex Code for Specific Colors -->


* One of best ways to represent color is with hexadecimal code,
or hex code for short.

* Hexadecimals (or hex) are base
  16 numbers.
     (This means it uses sixteen distinct symbols. Like decimals,
     the symbols 0-9 represent the values zero to nine. Then A,B,C,D,E,F
     represent the values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent
      a digit in hexadecimal, giving us 16 total possible values.)

* In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors,
  two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.
   For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value.


body {
  color: #000000;
}
