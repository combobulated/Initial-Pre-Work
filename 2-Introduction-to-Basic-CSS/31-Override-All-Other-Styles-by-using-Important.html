---- Assigment ---

Let's go all the way back to our pink-text class declaration.
Remember that our pink-text class was overridden by subsequent class
declarations, id declarations, and inline styles.

1) add the keyword !important to your pink-text element's color declaration
   to make 100% sure that your h1 element will be pink.

An example of how to do this is:

color: red !important;

Fix color to Pink using "!Important"

To insure no other CSS class overides our pink-text class, This commit
adds one word !important to the pink-text: ie color: pink !important;
Hello World will remain pink.  No ID Declaration or future CSS library
will override the color attribute.
