 CSS inheritance

Every HTML page has a body element.


We can prove that the body element exists here by giving it a
background-color of black.

---- Assignment ---

We can do this by adding the following to our style element:

body {
  background-color: black;
}

---- Commits ----
Change html "body" to black

This commit changes the html body to the color black using
the syle attribute for "body" with parameter background-color: black;
The color change is to show the area the body region covers as well
as demonstrate a style applied to the higher level body element.

<style>

  body {
  background-color: black;
}

</style>
