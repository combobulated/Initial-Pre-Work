<!-- Prioritize One Style Over Another -->

<!--

HTML elements will receive multiple styles
that conflict with one another.

ie your h1 element can't be both green and pink at the same time.
*** Child attribute overrides parent attribute! ****


---- Assignment ---
Let's see what happens when we create a class that makes text pink,
then apply it to an element. Will our class override the body
 element's color: green; CSS property?


Create a CSS class called pink-text that gives an element the color pink.

Give your h1 element the class of pink-text.

----- Commits ----
Overide color of header to pink

This commit shows that the element's applied class
overrides the parent html body's color attibute.
The body's color style attribute is set to green.
Once the class pink-text with attribute color pink
is applied to the header h1, the hello world color
overrides to pinkk

<style>

  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }

  .pink-text{
    color: pink;
  }

</style>

<h1 class="pink-text" >Hello World!</h1>
