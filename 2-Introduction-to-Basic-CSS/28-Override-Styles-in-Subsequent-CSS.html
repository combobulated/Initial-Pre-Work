<!-- Override Styles in Subsequent CSS -->

<!--

* what can we do to override our
 pink-text class?

 **** the order of the class declarations in
       the <style> section are what is important.
       The second declaration will always take precedence
       over the first. Because .blue-text is declared second,
        it overrides the attributes of .pink-text

---- Assignment ----
1) reate an additional CSS class called blue-text that gives an element
the color blue.

2) Make sure it's below your pink-text class declaration.

3) Apply the blue-text class to your h1 element in addition to
your pink-text class, and let's see which one wins.

* Applying multiple class attributes to a HTML element is done with
  a space between them like this:

      class="class1 class2"

* Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are
  listed in the HTML element.

Override pink text with blue text

This commit demonstrates how the order of the classes
defined in the style section determine the override
priority of class. Bottom position in the style
section overrides the top positions. This example
shows blue-text overriding pink text in the h1 header

  -->
  <style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }

.blue-text {
  color: blue
}

</style>
<h1 class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>
